					Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Andie (she/her), this is a place where I document my journey working in
					software & design since 2014.

				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					In my previous life, I was an excel whiz & map wrangler helping economists and town
					planners make better policy decisions with data. Through digital transformations in that sector, I discovered software development which ignited my curiousity in code, product and design.
				</p>
				<p class="leading-relaxed">
					Highlights from this journey is knowing that the products that I helped build are enabling
					people to live and work better through innovative use of technology. I'm always in awe how thoughtful design decisions can make a huge difference in making technology more palatable and less alienating to all especially those experiencing it for the first time.
