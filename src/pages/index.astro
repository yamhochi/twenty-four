			Hi there, I'm Andie. Product designer dabbling in the intersection of business and technical
			endeavours. Here are a collection of work done in the past 10 years. Some of them are pretty
			raw (we were all once a junior). Currently, I'm a senior product designer at a Software
			Consultancy in Sydney called Thinkmill. I split my time leading designers in project streams
			and hands on contribution with craft.
