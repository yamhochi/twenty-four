## Project intro

Homtrust serves as the dedicated accounting platform to oversee the full spectrum of services within the Homstar ecosystem, encompassing Homhero, Homdesk, Homsure, Homguard, and Hompay. Prior to its inception, these services were reliant on a third-party software vendor, a setup that presented a host of challenges and eroded client trust.

In response to these issues and to better meet customer needs, Thinkmill was commissioned to spearhead the development of Homtrust as an in-house proprietary solution for the business.

## Design Leadership and Bridging the Gap

As the design lead for this project, my role was pivotal in bridging the gap between research, business, and technical solutions to meet the project's criteria. Homtrust was a greenfield project, demanding specialised knowledge in accounting.

One of the most significant challenges was finding the right balance between user-led requirements and technical/domain-led solutions.

Collaborating closely with stakeholders, I drove the solution narrative by visualising complex procedures and addressing critical business and user pain points. I ensured that our solution aligned with how data models and schema designs mirrored the real world, guided by our solution architect's methodical mindset

## Building an Accounting Engine from Scratch

Once a solution model was agreed upon, my design team and I established checkpoints and rituals to ensure we were working towards a simple, lovable, and complete solution. This process involved several key elements:

- Development of a shared data and design document to facilitate collaboration between the schema and design teams, ensuring visibility of the data exchange strategy.
- Emphasis on rapid prototyping to validate solutions early and frequently, keeping the project on track.
- A close-knit design and front-end hand-off process to facilitate efficient discussions and refinements of interface interactions and feasibility.
- Implementation notes document to establish a close feedback loop between the implementation team and the business.

## Simplicity, Lovability, and Completeness

Under my leadership, the team excelled at extracting complex accounting flows and transformed them into seamless, elegant designs.

I encouraged my team to unpack ambiguous questions, guiding them to understand the "why" behind the solutions while remaining hands-on throughout the project.

The outcome of our collective efforts was the empowerment of customers to carry out end-to-end accounting functions more effectively than before. This achievement not only rekindled trust among existing clients but also allowed the business to refocus on its growth and business goals.
