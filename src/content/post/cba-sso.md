"Branch staff often share a single smartphone device within a given branch, to login each time using full staff password is time consuming. If each staff member could register a unique temporary pin with the device, it would allow quick authentication when switching between users."

## Setup pin

<div class="w-full my-9 p-8 text-center bg-[#DDE1E3] overflow-hidden">
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded inline-block items-center max-h-[37.5rem] h-screen w-auto"> 
    <video autoplay="" class="w-full h-full m-0 object-contain" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
      <source type="video/mp4" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ddgt1wiwm/video/upload/f_auto:video,q_auto/v1/twenty-four-assets/cbaSSO-setupPin">
    </video>
  </div>
</div>
This is the flow showing when a new user logs in for the first time, the system takes them through the screens where they would be guided to setup their 4-digit PIN

## Reset pin

<div class="w-full my-9 p-8 text-center bg-[#DDE1E3] overflow-hidden">
  <div class="overflow-hidden rounded inline-block items-center max-h-[37.5rem] h-screen w-auto"> 
    <video autoplay="" class="w-full h-full m-0 object-contain" loop="" muted="" playsinline="">
      <source type="video/mp4" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/ddgt1wiwm/video/upload/f_auto:video,q_auto/v1/twenty-four-assets/cbaSSO-resetPin">
    </video>
  </div>
</div>

The user is asked to reset their 4 digit PIN if they have not logged in for more than 30 days

## Flow overview

Working on a constrained budget and timeline, I took a lean design approach and guided the development team to iron out any usability frictions and work towards the best possible outcome
