Vocal ($VOCL), a publishing platform created by Creatd, is a unique platform designed to empower individuals to explore their creativity through writing and build meaningful connections within their community. Thinkmill has been a dedicated technology partner for Vocal since its inception.

This case study provides insights into the transformative journey of Vocal's design and product strategy from 2020 to 2022, highlighting key milestones and contributions I made as design lead, as well as the impact on Vocal's audience and product offerings.

## Design foundations & product strategy

1. With a fresh team on board and investments in re-platforming the front-end and back-end codebase, my initial focus was on enhancing Vocal's design foundations to support future scalability.
2. The development of a robust design system allowed for quicker and more efficient feature rollouts, paving the way for a more streamlined user experience.
3. With the team, I worked out a process of re-evaluating the business backlog to identify features that could benefit from this enhanced design system was crucial in building confidence in the design's value.

## Understanding our audience

Recognising the significance of understanding user needs and preferences, I led the team to embark on a comprehensive 3-month discovery journey. Over 3,000 users were surveyed, and numerous interviews were conducted across the US, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.

This research yielded both qualitative and quantitative insights, which were instrumental in defining customer segments more effectively. The newfound insights also played a pivotal role in identifying features that would enhance the product's monetisation strategy.

## Shaping features customers love

From the research findings, a range of potential features emerged. To assist the business in making informed decisions, I evaluated each feature using cost and opportunity weightings. This analysis served as a valuable tool for determining both short-term and long-term priorities.

My approach led to increased confidence in investing in features such as comment sections and community-enhancing experiences that strongly resonated with the core audience and were essential for customer retention.

The success of the Vocal Reader App indicated that the investments made in product design and strategy were delivering significant value.

The seamless and relevant user experience across different platforms was particularly valued by the most active customers who frequently transitioned between writing on the web and reading on their devices. This, in turn, solidified Vocal's position as a formidable player in the online publishing market, equipped with a competitive suite of first-class products.

As Vocal's long-term and short-term roadmap continued to unfold, I took an active role in delving into custom reports to gauge usage and adoption with real data.

Identifying key indicators that influenced ongoing segmentation efforts and product strategy, the team could confidently continue delivering on priorities and refine their roadmap as needed. This approach allowed Vocal to remain agile and responsive to the evolving needs and preferences of its audience.
